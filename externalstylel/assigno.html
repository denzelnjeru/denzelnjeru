        <h1>TRIBUTE TO AYUB NJERU</h1>
        <P1> I would like to picture you as the man who taught me everything i know.From tying my shoe laces, riding a bicycle to becoming a responsible young man.<br>I not only see you as my greatest motivation but also my mentor, you have been a true inspiration through your actions as the head of the family as well as your unshakable mentality. Truly, you have always been there for us as a family and for that I am forever in your debt.</br>
        </P1>
        <p2> It took me a while to realise that all the punishments from the disputes we previously had were to only make me act accordingly and to make the right decision when the nned arises.<br> Words cannot express my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation for all the risks you take for our family, so i would like to take this opportunity to raise a toast to the best father in the world ! </p2>
